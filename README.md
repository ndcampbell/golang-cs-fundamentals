# Golang CS Fundamentals

This project is just me playing around with Go, trying to implement some CS fundamentals and data structures such as:

- Linked Lists
- Queue/Stack
- Binary Search Tree
- Recursion examples
- etc ( Put in an issue if you have any fun ideas)

### Running

1. Clone the project
2. Make sure your $GOPATH is correctly set
    - `export GOPATH=/path/to/root`
    - https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH
3. Go into the project directory and run/compile the code
     - `go run main.go`
     - `go build` and `./golang-cs-fundamentals`
